# CodeFirst-Python_material
Resources developed for the advanced Python course @CodeFirst

Many of the resources are in the format of Jupyter notebooks. Which are interactive
displays of Python code.

The material should be easy to follow:
* Good coding practices and Zen_basic were covered in session 2... follow them and your code will be amazing!!!
* Session 1 and 2 summary: partial summary of what you have worked on
  - variables
  - text files (write, read, copy)
  - functions
* Boolean: A small tuto on Boolean operators and some examples
* Challenges: well.. challenges for those who dare
* Terminal/comand prompt tutorial: only for Mac and Linux at the moment, will be updating it soon
* Sending emails using Mailgun and Python
* Getting weather
